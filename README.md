### Tell me what this does!
Basically, this software show 5 digis that represent **AUTOSAVE** light tube. We use _syphon_ to export the screen to `madmapper`(or resolume as your choice), Then the madmapper sent signal to the `LED RBG 5050 encoder` board to trigger on/off to `relays`, then it turn on/off the Fluorescent light tube. The software collects 10 digis data, user will be able to type alphabets, number, and able to type following special chars : '_', '-', '<', '>', '=', '|', '}'
and it will push the displayed text from right to left. 
There will be a click noise for every key.
User can also delete the text using DEL key, clear the text using tab key, and space using space key.


### How to use this things!

You need the following software to run this 
  - Processing (https://processing.org/) 
  - Sound library for processing.
  - Syphon library for processing.
  - midibus library for processing.

both library shits can be installed easily by Processing, just click
```sh
sktech > import library > add library
```
and search for Sound, Midibus and Syphon, then click install.
