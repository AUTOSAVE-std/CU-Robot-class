Actual program custom for you! This is a class material part2 for creative interactive technology 100++ BURNNN BY AUTOSAVE studio. 
This week achievement :

  - Understand/realize/absorb technical area, criteria
  - Run programs
  - Edit programs
  - Play with different i/0

Only fundamental!, you only need to understand limitation and all that in order to work with technician, not to make it yourself. If you do not understand programming, you are forgiven. We just want you to think in technician shoes.


### Tell me what this does!
Basically, this software show 5 digis that represent **AUTOSAVE** light tube. We use _syphon_ to export the screen to `madmapper`(or resolume as your choice), Then the madmapper sent signal to the `LED RBG 5050 encoder` board to trigger on/off to `relays`, then it turn on/off the Fluorescent light tube. The software collects 10 digis data, user will be able to type alphabets, number, and able to type following special chars : '_', '-', '<', '>', '=', '|', '}'
and it will push the displayed text from right to left. 
There will be a click noise for every key.
User can also delete the text using DEL key, clear the text using tab key, and space using space key.


### How to use this things!

You need the following software to run this 
  - Processing  flexible software sketchbook for the visual arts.  [please install it](https://processing.org/) 
  - Arduino  IDE 1.8.1 - software writing code and uploading it to the board. [please install it](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
